# increment_counter
The counter-increment property defines how much the values of counters should increase or decrease. This property is used with the content and counter-reset properties.

The counter-increment property is specified by two values: none and id numbers. "None" is the default value of this property. It allows to use negative values in the case of "id number" value. The default increment is 1. If counter id is not initialized by counter-reset, the default value is 0. The value of the counter can be set to an arbitrary number with the counter-reset property
